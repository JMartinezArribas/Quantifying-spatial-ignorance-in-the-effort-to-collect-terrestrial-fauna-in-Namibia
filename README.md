Identifying and mapping biodiversity knowledge shortfalls in sub-Saharan Africa using ignorance scores to
discover the factors driving the availability of recent species occurrence records from the Global
Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) for multiple taxa at a spatial scale of 10 × 10 km.
Modelling the relationship between ignorance scores and a set of socio-geographical variables
with generalized additive models for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS).
